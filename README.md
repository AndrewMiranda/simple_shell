### Unix shell
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

## 0x16. C - Simple shell
This project is made for the holbertonSchoolColombia school, the objective is to create a simple unix command interpreter.

------------
## functions shell
| Function name | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `exit()`      | command to end the shell script.|
| `function_name()`|and that's what you will use to call it from elsewhere in your scripts.|

## Means
Read or watch:
1. Unix shell
2. Thompson shell
3. Ken thompson
4. Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell concept page

# Learning Objectives
the school gives us different learning objectives which are
- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / ‚Äúend-of-file‚Äù?
